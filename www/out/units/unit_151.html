Ambiguity can also be \emph{syntactic}, e.g. `How to combat the feeling of helplessness with illegal drugs'.  (Both examples are from Bucaria, C. (2004), `Lexical and syntactic ambiguity as a source of humor: The case of newspaper headlines', Humour 17(3): 279--309.)</div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/unit_151/slide-083.jpeg" class="bkg"/><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">But, to be fair, how could one not?</div><div class="notes">Anyway, here he's saying 'I need a heir' and holding up a hair.</div><div class="notes">This is one example of ambiguity.</div><div class="notes">Note that here the ambiguity can be traced to a single word, 'heir' which sounds just like another word with a different meaning.

The sentence 'Two puffins ate six fish' is ambiguous but the ambiguity is not due to any particular word.

The answer doesn't enable us to prove that our language contains no ambiguous sentences.</div><div class="notes">And, second, it's not satisfying because we haven't said anything yet about what the brackets mean.  We can't just throw symbols into our language without explaining them. (This is the down side of having a formal language: we have to say what everything means explicity, since it's a creature of our own creation.)</div></div></div></div></section><div class="exercises">3.20, 3.21, 3.22</div></div></body></html>
