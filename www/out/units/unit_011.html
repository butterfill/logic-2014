To say that a sentence is logically true is to say that there's no possible situation in which it is false.

rational agents,
and we are none of us entirely rational.
It is slightly harder to escape gravity, which was 
thought to apply to all physical things although Tariq Trotter claims to have done it 
on Game Theory (Livin’ in a New World).
The laws of logic are fundamental in the sense that 
absolutely everything is subject to them, even musicians.</div><div class="notes">After I heard Game Theory I 
tried to get the philosophy department to put Tariq forward for an honourary doctorate
