//- *TODO remove -- now part of unit 390 but forgot to include in 2013-4
.exercises_fast 8.20--8.25

//- *DONE: move the subproofs earlier or update exercises
  'Last weeks seminar exercises (week 2's, due in this Monday) was all new material and it took a lot of time to learn what subproofs and rules were and how it all works, because that's what the exercises were about.  Then I come to the fast track lecture today, and it covers subproofs and rules, which I had taught myself to do the exercises.
  I'm just wondering why we do exercises before we cover the material which we need to do the exercises, hence we have to teach it to ourselves then go to a lecture to rehear it after we've self taught it.'
