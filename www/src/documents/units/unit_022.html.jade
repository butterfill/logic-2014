  When you use logic-ex you can type words instead of using symbols.
  But which words stand for which symbols?  Here’s a list.

  .notes: :t
    When typing proofs or sentences, it’s often awkward to enter symbols.
    In the first-order language awFOL, you can use words as well as symbols (they are
    treated as equivalent).  This makes typing easier.
    And since logic-ex recognises awFOL, you can use the words in logic-ex.

    Here’s a table listing the words you can use for each symbol.
