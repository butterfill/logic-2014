  .handout An argument is \emph{logically valid} just if thereâ€™s no possible situation in which the premises are true and the conclusion false
  .handout A \emph{counterexample} to an argument is a possible situation in which its premises are true and its conclusion false.

  .notes Consider this argument.  It is logically valid.

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-002.jpeg'})
  .notes That is, there is no possible situation in which its premises are true and its conclusion false.

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-003.jpeg'})
  .notes Here's a possible situation in which the premises and conclusion are true.

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-004.jpeg'})
  .notes Recall that a counterexample to this argument is a possible situation in which its premises are true and its conclusion false.
  .notes: :t()
    Where there is a counterexample to an argument, it is not logically valid;
    and where an argument is not logically valid, there is a counterexample to it.
  .notes: :t()
    So since this argument is logically valid (that's clear, no?), there is no counterexample 
    to it.

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-005.jpeg'})
  .notes: :t()
    Let's check this.  First you can see that premises and conclusion are true in this 
    possible situation; so this is no counterexample.

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-007.jpeg'})
  .notes 

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-008.jpeg'})
  .notes 

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-009.jpeg'})
  .notes So let's try to change the situation to make the premises true and the concluion false.

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-010.jpeg'})
  .notes Now the conclusion is false.

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-011.jpeg'})
  .notes But in making the conclusion false, we also made the second premise false.
  .notes So this possible situation is no counterexample.

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-012.jpeg'})
  .notes We can make the second premise true by moving b.

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-013.jpeg'})
  .notes So far so good ...

+slide({bkg:'unit_05/slide-014.jpeg'})
  .notes ... but now we've made the first premise false.
  .notes So we still don't have a counterexample.
  .notes And as you can probably see, we aren't going to find one because there isn't one.
  .notes That is, the argument is logically valid.
